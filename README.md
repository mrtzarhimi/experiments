# 🧪 experiment

A personal research & experimentation repository — where I explore, reproduce, and extend ideas from papers I read.  
This space serves as a living lab for testing algorithms, implementing small prototypes, and documenting insights along the way.

## 📘 Overview

This repository collects:
- 🔬 **Paper reproductions** — faithful or modified implementations of research works.  
- 🧩 **Experiments** — independent ideas, ablations, or small studies derived from literature.  
- 💡 **Insights** — theoretical or practical notes, comparisons, and reflections on results.

Each experiment lives in its own folder.
